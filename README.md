NoiseBall5
==========

This is a Unity example project that shows how to use Unity 2019.3 new Mesh API
with C# Job System.

The vertices in the Noise Ball object are modified every frame from threaded
jobs that are highly optimized using the Burst compiler. Vertex attributes are
interleaved and stored in a `NativeArray` storage and fed to the graphics APIs
without extra memory copying.

For details of the new Mesh API, please refer to the [Google doc].
